// app.get("/api/v1/tours", getAllTours);

// When we use middleware to serve static files, we don't include the /public in the URL, because nodeJS will automatically look into the public folder if it can't find the route in the URL, kinda sets the folder to be the root.

//  It kinda works only for static files, not for anything as if we dont specify a static file, node will treat it as a route and say its not defined
